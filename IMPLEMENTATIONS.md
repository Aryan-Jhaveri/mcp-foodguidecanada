# Implementations
A list future ideas, tasks, and ideas to improve/maintain the mcp server

### May 30, 2025
[] Add a temporary and/or permanent database system for LLMs to input ingredients and use math tools to adjust serving size, store favorites in recipes (look into creating embedding for recipe titles, and creating an automated pipe that pulls and updated recipe title db)

[] Remove nutritional information tag for recipes

[] Make windows version of setup

[] Maybe create a tool to create .ics files (need to see how different LLM clients display artifacts)
