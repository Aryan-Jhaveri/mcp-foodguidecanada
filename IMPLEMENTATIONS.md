# Implementations
A list future ideas, tasks, and ideas to improve/maintain the mcp server

### May 30, 2025
[] Add a temporary and/or permanent database system for LLMs to
    - To input ingredients 
    - To use math tools to adjust serving size, 
    - To store favorites in recipes
    - To calculate calories and calories per serving 
    
    (look into creating embedding for recipe titles, and creating an automated pipe that pulls and updated recipe title db)

[] Remove nutritional information tag for recipes

[] Make windows version of setup and installation

[] Maybe create a tool to create .ics files (need to see how different LLM clients display artifacts)
